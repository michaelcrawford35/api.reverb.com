A small application I wrote while learning tinkering with Laravel Reverb while watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLSxcxFRl4).

This project uses Laravel Breeze for user authentication as well as Laravel Reverb for the websockets which power the chatroom.

For front-end display, the application is using Livewire and Blade.
